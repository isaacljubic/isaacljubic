- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @isaacljubic
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Blockchain, AI, and low-level programming. I am currently developing the Valency Exchange, which is a cryptocurrency exchange that will launch Q4 2024 in Australia. 
- ðŸŒ± My previous projects include valency-core - a modular framework used to build the valency network. You can read more about this project here: https://valency.dev/The-Valency-Project.pdf
- ðŸ’µ The Valency Exchange enables low-fee spot trades through our group of industry leading partners. Our app is open-source, and we provide the lowest initial fee of ANY Australian Exchange.
- ðŸ’¸ **The Valency Exchange is being bootstrapped until release! Please email me if you have any business enquiries.**
