**VALENCY:** <br>
**Aussie. Open-Source. Super-Low Fees.** <br>

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @isaacljubic
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Blockchain and low-level programming. I am currently developing the Valency Exchange, which is a cryptocurrency exchange that will launch Q3 2025 in Australia. 
- ðŸŒ± My previous projects include valency-core - a modular framework used to build the valency network (quantum-proof cryptography, networking framework, hashing algorithm, Web-Based UI Interface (allowing HTML/CSS UI with C++ Backend)).
- ðŸ’µ The Valency Exchange enables low-fee spot trades through our group of industry leading partners. Our app is open-source, and we provide the lowest initial fee of ANY Australian Exchange. <br>
- Valency will be releasing an Open-Source Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet sometime in the near future (crowdfunded).  This is currently in development now. <br>
