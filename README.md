- 👋 Hi, I’m @isaacljubic
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain, AI, and low-level programming. I am currently developing the Valency Project, which consists of a decentralized network and cryptocurrency exchange. You can read more here: https://valency.dev/The-Valency-Project.pdf
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my UX and UI design ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Valency Project with people who have experience in Blockchain development (from scratch) and C++.
- 💵 Currently raising seed capital to get an MVP for my cryptocurrency exchange up and running.
