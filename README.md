- 👋 Hi, I’m @isaacljubic
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain, AI, and low-level programming. I am currently developing the Valency Project, which consists of a decentralized network and cryptocurrency exchange. You can read more here: https://valency.dev/The-Valency-Project.pdf
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my UX and UI design ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Valency Project with people who have experience in Blockchain development (from scratch) and C++.
- 💵 I'm currently focusing 100% of my effort on Valency - a cryptocurrency exchange built with technology that enables transparency.
- 💸 ~Currently raising seed capital to get regulated in Australia - this will allow me to launch my cryptocurrency exchange to the public.~ **Now Bootstrapping until exchange app release!**
- 📫 You can reach me at: isaacljubic@valency.dev
